Notes to self (Boisei0):
Why is actors panel visible when project is newly created, but gives an error when opened from file:
Traceback (most recent call last):

When closing the Actors Panel popup:
The program 'python2.7' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'GLXBadDrawable'.
  (Details: serial 338114 error_code 169 request_code 154 minor_code 11)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

No errors on closing the Classes Panel popup, where does it differ with the Actors Panel?
Same error again on closing the Enemies Panel (no errors on panels in between)
